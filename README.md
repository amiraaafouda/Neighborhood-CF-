# Recommendations with MovieTweetings: Collaborative Filtering       
One of the most popular methods for making recommendations is collaborative filtering. In collaborative filtering, you are using the collaboration of user-item recommendations to assist in making new recommendations.           

There are two main methods of performing collaborative filtering:          

- Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering, which is based on the idea that we can either correlate items that are similar to provide recommendations or we can correlate users to one another to provide recommendations.          
 
- Model Based Collaborative Filtering, which is based on the idea that we can use machine learning and other mathematical models to understand the relationships that exist amongst items and users to predict ratings and provide ratings.        

in this notebook I will be implementing user-based collaborative filtering. However, it is easy to extend this approach to make recommendations using item-based collaborative filtering.
